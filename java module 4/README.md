# Overview

I was trying to create a clicker game mobile app. I thought it would be a fun project that would be easily modifiable. This was not the case.

I enjoy clicker games, I think that they allow for a lot of creative freedom, so I wanted to make one.

# Development Environment

I used Android Studio, and let me say, never before has an application, specifically created to help you make something, made me so viscerally angery and confused.

I followed over 2 hours of tutorials on how to use it for first time users and they were not helpful, the thing has an alright layout at best, but if you aren't using kotlin then you will have no luck using this application. I made it further using the eclipse IDE from 2018 than I did with android studio. This matters because android studio is supposed to have all the tool needed to easy make android apps, but the "built in emulators and installation tool" just errored out saying they were unable to install or they redirected me to a site that no longer offered what android studio said should be there.
