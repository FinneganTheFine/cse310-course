# Overview

I have been working on trying to create an app with a react frontend and an express backend so that I can connect it to a mysql database. Alas, I don't like react, express is much easier to use and much more flexible than react. I got most of the way there and according to the internet my program should work it just doesn't. I will take the wins where I can especially in this stressful project. I will continue to work on it until I can get it to work, but I don't know how long that will take.

# Web Pages

Currently it is just one webpage, but later there will be many as I'm using this as a base for figuring out how to help my group, but it should just display database information and allow for you to add to the database, but react doesn't feel like it so we'll have to check again later.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode to write and organize all my code, I used the mysql library and the express js and react js app frameworks to create this abomination. if I hadn't used react it would work. but I had to jumble up the express js to fit within the requirments of linking to react which definitely ruined the origin express app, but there is a copy of the origin working express app in the folder labeled expressApp in the root of the repository.
