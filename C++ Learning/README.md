# Overview

{Important! Do not say in this section that this is college assignment. Talk about what you are trying to accomplish as a software engineer to further your learning.}

{Provide a description of the software that you wrote to demonstrate the C++ language.}

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used vscode for a bit but then started having trouble with it so I found an online compiler for C++ and that worked really well. I used the include feature for strings, fstream, and iostream (strings, file stream, and input/output streams)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I want to create a loop that checks if there is already text in the file and writes to the end of the file instead of writing over the text
- I would like to make my program less redundant, because I could have just not used the class and it would be faster
