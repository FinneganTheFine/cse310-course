# Overview

I wrote a simple guess the number game using java. It runs in the console and uses that Scanner utility and the Math library to generate the number and to read the user input.

Making a guess the number game seemed like it would be a lot more fun than a file reader/writer.

# Development Environment

I used eclipse IDE for Java Developers, it's a java compiler and virtual machine made by oracle eclipse who owns java.

I used the java language for this project, it's similar to C# because C# is the microsoft copy of java, I used the Scanner Utility to get user input for the game, because without user input the game wouldn't work very well.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Adding a UI would be fun
- Adding some kind of on win effect or something would be fun
- Adding graphics or a guess limit would be a good idea too.
